# Initialize Context

Initialize the `.contexts/` directory structure for project documentation and context management.

**Usage**: `/contexts:init`

## What This Command Does

This command creates the foundational directory structure for managing project context:

- Creates `.contexts/` root directory if it doesn't exist
- Sets up subdirectories: `adrs/`, `specs/`, `conventions/`

The command only creates the directory structure. Context documentation is generated automatically by other commands when you work on features or make architectural decisions.

## Implementation

**Step 1: Create Directory Structure**

Create the base structure:

```bash
mkdir -p .contexts/adrs
mkdir -p .contexts/specs
mkdir -p .contexts/conventions
```

**Step 2: Verify Structure**

Verify the directories were created:

```bash
tree .contexts -L 1
```

**Step 3: Report Success**

Report to user:
- "Context directory structure initialized successfully."
- List the created directories
- Explain that documentation will be generated automatically as you work

## Success Criteria

- `.contexts/` directory exists
- Subdirectories created: `adrs/`, `specs/`, `conventions/`
- User informed of successful initialization
- User understands that content is generated by other workflows
